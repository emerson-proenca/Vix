```
To compile your file:
```powershell
vix myfile.vix -o myapplication.exe
```

## ✨ Features

- **Fast**: Performance comparable to C/C++ using Clang compiler
- **Memory Safe**: Built in safety without garbage collection overhead and using borrow checker and ownership system
- **Simple Syntax**: Easy to read and write, quick to learn and develop with. No using of "{}" only "end"
